# Future directions

There are endless possibilities to extend Collagen.

Here just a list of some ideas concerning possible future extension:

- Add other datasets
- Add an option for specifying an image directory
- Add an option for generating batches of digit sequences from a list of sequenses in a text file
- Add an option for generating batches of random digit sequences (with a random length etc.)
- Generate html pages for visualizing the batches of digit sequences
- Generate grids for the visualisation of possible augmentation strategies and parameters
- Experiment with Keras and Collagen
- Better integration with Keras
- Use Genetic Algorithms to experiment with augmentation parameters
