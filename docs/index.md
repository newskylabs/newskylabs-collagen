NewSkyLabs Collagen - COLlaborative LAbs' dataset GENerator

## Overview

Notes on the prerequisites, the installation and deinstallation can be
found on this page:

- [Installation](user-guide/installation.md)

On the "Getting Started" page you'll find information about the basic
usage of `collagen`, the command line tool for generating sequences,
grids, data sets etc.

- [Getting Started](user-guide/getting-started.md)

For character recognizion the number and variation of learning samples
is of greatest importance.  Beside the digit shapes found in some
dataset like MNIST, data augmentation is a helpful tool to generate
unlimited variations on the base of the models found in the dataset:

Experiments with Musical Notation

- [Experiments with Musical Notation](user-guide/experiments-with-musical-notation.md)

Some general notes concerning my implementation:

- [Implementation](user-guide/implementation.md)

During the development of `collagen` it was helpful to write some
development tools rather than repeating the same commands manually
over and over again:

- [Development Tools](user-guide/development-tools.md)

The same is true for the documentation.  On this page you find some
tools which make the process easier:

- [Documentation Tools](user-guide/documentation-tools.md)
